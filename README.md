# Term_Deposit_Subscription
Data science project to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit.



   The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. 
   The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, 
   in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed. 
   
   The dataset shows around 12% conversion rate, i.e., out of the total individuals contacted, around 12% subscribed to the term deposit. 
	The problem is best framed as binary   	classification, which predicts whether a customer will subscribe to the term deposit or not by identifying the important 					characteristics of a customer. 
	These customers can be 	 targeted to increase the bankâ€™s profit and ROI, while resulting in an overall reduction in the cost and effort of the bank.
	The data was analysed to understand the impact of the independent features against the rate of subscription and the conversion rate was increased from 12% to 40% using a 			machine learning model.
